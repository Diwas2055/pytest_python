# File Execution

We will learn how to execute single test file and multiple test files. We already have a test file ***test_square.py*** created. Create a new test file ***test_compare.py*** with the following code −

```python
# test_compare.py

def test_greater():
   num = 100
   assert num > 100

def test_greater_equal():
   num = 100
   assert num >= 100

def test_less():
   num = 100
   assert num < 200
```

Now to run all the tests from all the files (*2 files here*) we need to run the following command −

```bash
pytest -v
```

To execute the tests from a specific file, use the following syntax −

```bash
pytest <filename> -v

```

Now, run the following command −

```bash
pytest test_compare.py -v
```
