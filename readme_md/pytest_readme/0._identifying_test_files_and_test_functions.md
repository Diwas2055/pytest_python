# Identifying Test files and Test Functions

Running pytest without mentioning a filename will run all files of format **test_*.py** or ***_test.py** in the current directory and subdirectories. Pytest automatically identifies those files as test files. We **can** make pytest run other filenames by explicitly mentioning them.

Pytest requires the test function names to start with ***test***. Function names which are not of format ***test**** are not considered as test functions by pytest. We **cannot** explicitly make pytest consider any function not starting with **test** as a test function.
