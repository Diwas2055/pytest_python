# Test Execution Results in XML Format

We can generate the details of the test execution in an xml file. This xml file is mainly useful in cases where we have a dashboard that projects the test results. In such cases, the xml can be parsed to get the details of the execution.

We will now execute the tests from test_multiplcation.py and generate the xml by running

```bash
pytest test_multiplication.py -v --junitxml="result.xml"
```

Now we can see result.xml is generated with the following data −

```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "utf-8"?>
<testsuite errors = "0" failures = "1"
name = "pytest" skips = "0" tests = "4" time = "0.061">
   <testcase classname = "test_multiplication"
      file = "test_multiplication.py"
      line = "2" name = "test_multiplication_11[1-11]"
      time = "0.00117516517639>
   </testcase>

   <testcase classname = "test_multiplication"
      file = "test_multiplication.py"
      line = "2" name = "test_multiplication_11[2-22]"
      time = "0.00155973434448">
   </testcase>

   <testcase classname = "test_multiplication"
      file = "test_multiplication.py"
      line = "2" name = "test_multiplication_11[3-35]" time = "0.00144290924072">
      failure message = "assert (11 * 3) == 35">num = 3, output = 35

         @pytest.mark.parametrize("num,
         output",[(1,11),(2,22),(3,35),(4,44)])

         def test_multiplication_11(num, output):>
         assert 11*num == output
         E assert (11 * 3) == 35

         test_multiplication.py:5: AssertionErro
      </failure>
   </testcase>
   <testcase classname = "test_multiplication"
      file = "test_multiplication.py"

Here, the tag **<testsuit>** summarises there were 4 tests and the number of failures are 1.

- The tag **<testcase>** gives the details of each executed test.
- <failure> tag gives the details of the failed test code.
