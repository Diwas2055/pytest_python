# Hypothesis In Pytest

In Pytest, a hypothesis is a powerful library that allows you to perform property-based testing. Property-based testing is a type of testing where you specify certain properties or in-variants that your code should always satisfy, and then you let the testing framework generate a wide range of test cases to check if those properties hold true for your code under various conditions. This approach can help discover edge cases and unexpected behaviors that might not be apparent with traditional example-based testing.

Hypothesis lets you write tests which instead look like this:

1. For all data matching some specification.
2. Perform some operations on the data.
3. Assert something about the result.

```python
# test_example.py

import pytest
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

# define a property function
@given(st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_addition(x, y):
    result = x + y
    assert result == y + x  # The commutative property of addition

@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_reverse_reverse_is_identity(lst):
    reversed_lst = list(reversed(lst))
    double_reversed = list(reversed(reversed_lst))
    assert lst == double_reversed  # Reversing twice should be the same as the original list

```

> Note:- The `@given` decorator may be used to specify which arguments of a function should be parametrized over.`strategies` define how to generate input data for your tests. For example, you can use`st.integers()` to generate integers, `st.text()` to generate text, and so on.
