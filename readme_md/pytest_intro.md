# Pytest Python

Pytest is a popular Python testing framework that allows you to write single, comprehensive tests for functional, testing, XUnit, and more. Pytest's tutorial series is a series of easy-to-follow guides that help beginners understand how to use Pytest for their Python development projects. With Pytest, you can create and organize testing  

Pytest is a python based testing framework, which is used to write and execute test codes. In the present days of REST services, pytest is mainly used for API testing even though we can use pytest to write simple to complex tests, i.e., we can write codes to test API, database, UI, etc.

## **Advantages of Pytest**

The advantages of Pytest are as follows âˆ’

- Pytest can run multiple tests in parallel, which reduces the execution time of the test suite.
- Pytest has its own way to detect the test file and test functions automatically, if not mentioned explicitly.
- Pytest allows us to skip a subset of the tests during execution.
- Pytest allows us to run a subset of the entire test suite.
- Pytest is free and open source.
- Because of its simple syntax, pytest is very easy to start with.
